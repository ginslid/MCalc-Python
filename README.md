# MCalc-Python

Program to calculate the final grades of students following some previously stablished criteria. I wrote it to help me get a better understanding and learn about OOP in Python.

There's another repository called MCalc with the same program but written in C# and commented in portuguese.

To use it just run main.py on your IDLE.
